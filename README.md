# odin-recipes
This project is a basic html website that displays recipes including images, ingredients, and steps to making each recipe.

This project has helped me develop the following skills:
    - Basic HTML (headers, ordered / unordered lists, absolute / relative URLs, images)
    - Git(clone repository, add to staging area, commit, quality commit messages,  push to Github)
    - Basic CSS (external style sheet, referencing css in html, other css basics)
